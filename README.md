# Portfolio Site

Personal Portfolio Website

I created my own portfolio website to show future employers my web development skills and to provide links to show case my personal projects. Being in the military, alot of my work based projects cannot be shown for security reasons. Owing to this its important to be able to showcase personal projects. Whilst these projects may not be finished to such high standards, they show my continued efforts to learn and eplore new technologies outside of the workplace.

I wanted to create the site without any framework so that I could further develop my abilities in plain HTML5 and CSS3. I've utilised frameworks such as Bootstrap 4 during work projects to make quick attractive front-ends, however this site demonstrates my ability to build a site from scratch without this assistance. 

I've used a small amount of JavaScript and jQuery to deal with aspects such as the navbar and animations on scrolling into a new area. In addition i've since added the particles.js library to create a custom intractive background on the initial landing page. I found this created an understated clean and simple geometric pattern to complement the theme of the site whilst adding some further interest.
